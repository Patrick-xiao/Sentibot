Sentiment Analysis Project: Fine - Tuning BERT for Sentiment Classification
1. Project Overview
This project focuses on fine - tuning the BERT model using a dataset containing text and corresponding labels for sentiment analysis. By leveraging the power of BERT, we aim to build a robust model that can accurately classify the sentiment of given text as positive, negative, or neutral. The project consists of two main parts: model training and online deployment.
2. Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directory structure:
plaintext
.
├── Online_Deployment
│   ├── sentibot_online.html
│   └── Sentibot_website.txt
├── Sentibot_training
│   ├── Sentibot_training.ipynb
│   ├── performance_evaluation4.csv
│   └── sentiment_analysis.csv
Explanation of Each Component
Online_Deployment:
sentibot_online.html: A static HTML page that allows users to input text and get the predicted sentiment.
Sentibot_website.txt: Contains the link to the deployed static webpage on the server, which can be accessed directly.
Sentibot_training:
Sentibot_training.ipynb: The core Jupyter Notebook file that outlines the entire process of training the model using the provided dataset.
performance_evaluation4.csv: A CSV file presenting the performance of the trained model. It has three columns: text, sentiment, and predict_sentiment.
sentiment_analysis.csv: The original dataset used for training the model, which includes text and corresponding sentiment labels.
3. Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
A compatible web browser for accessing the online deployment
Install Dependencies
The project relies on several Python libraries. You can install them using the following command:
bash
pip install torch transformers pandas
4. How to Use
Model Training
Navigate to the Sentibot_training directory.
Open the Sentibot_training.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially. The notebook will guide you through the data pre - processing, model fine - tuning, and evaluation steps.
Online Deployment
Local Testing:
Open the sentibot_online.html file in your web browser. You can then input text and see the predicted sentiment.
Server - based Access:
Open the Sentibot_website.txt file and copy the provided link.
Paste the link into your web browser to access the deployed application.
5. Dataset
sentiment_analysis.csv: This is the raw dataset used for training the model. It contains text samples and their corresponding sentiment labels.
performance_evaluation4.csv: This file is generated after the model training and evaluation. It provides insights into how well the model performs on a test set, with columns for the original text, actual sentiment, and predicted sentiment.
